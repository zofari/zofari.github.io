title:  Join a Chargepoint Waitlist, Automatically

[Chargepoint](https://www.chargepoint.com/) has a nice feature that automatically puts you on a given waitlist at a given time of day, but this feature might have been _blocked_ by your company's admin. To get past the restriction, one has to be creative.

There are two APIs needed from Chargepoint:

1. User login
2. Join a waitlist identified by a numeric ID at a given time of day

With these I wrote a bash script that can put you on a waitlist from the command line, with the following provided:

* User name for your Chargepoint account
* Password
* Waitlist ID, which you can find by joining that particular waitlist on the Chargepoint web interface and inspect the URL being fired up

With the script and the necessary info ready, you can use _cron_ to run the script on a schedule. If you are a Mac user, you may choose _launchd_ instead.

__Note__ If you are scheduling the script on your laptop, make sure your laptop is not sleeping or turned off at the scheduled times.

# The Script

```
{% include chargepoint-join-waitlist.sh %}
```

# Future Improvement

To be more user friendly, instead of asking for waitlist ID, use waitlist name from the UI instead. This requires another API to get the list of waitlists/regions.
