I like Buddhism, minimalism, meditation, tea, listening to rain, living frugally, Asian food, Asian cultures, reading, writing, doing nothing, pretty arts, budget gadgets, making plans, ignoring plans, taking photos, home decorating, watching fiddle leaf fig grow, watching dead plants reviving, propagating baby succulents, keeping pet fish, ... Oh, I like `coding` too.
